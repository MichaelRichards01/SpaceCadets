This is a 1 hour bodge xD

Tabs have been replaced with "-" since Java is incapable of counting the number 
of tabs that a line is indented by.

Simple Operations
-----------------

int x = 0;          clear x;            Declare a variable / Assign 0 to variable.

x++;                incr x;             Increment a variable.
x--;                decr x;             Decrement a variable. 

x = y;              set x y;            Assigns a variable the value of anoter varaible.
x = 5;              setval x 5;

x += y;             add x y;            Adds the value of a variable to another variable.
x += 5;             addval x 5;
x = y + z;          addeq x y x;[not done]        Assigns a variable the sum value of two other variables. [not done]

x -= y;             sub x y;
x -= 5;             subval x 5;
x = y - z;          subeq x y z; [not done]

x *= y;             mlt x y;
x *= 5;             mltval x 5;
x = y * z;          mlteq x y z; [not done]

x /= y;             div x y;
x /= 5;             divval x 5;
x = y / z;          diveq x y z; [not done]

Loops
-----

while (x != 0)      while x not 0 do;               Loop until x equals 0.
{                   -{code}
}                   end;

Branching Statements
--------------------

n/a                 branch :a                       Branch to line with :a label.
n/a                 bequal :a x y;                  Branch to line with :a label if x equals y.
n/a                 bequalval :a x 5; [not done]    Branch to line with :a lable if x equals a value.  
n/a                 bless 8 x y;                    Branch to line 8 if x is less than y.
n/a                 blessval 8 x 5; [not done]      Branch to line 8 if x is less than a value.
